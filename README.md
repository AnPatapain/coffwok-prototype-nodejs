<b>Key Idea</b> -> The networking app that allows you to build a network with people in your industry through a coworking meeting at a cafe

Have you ever wanted to connect or discuss something in your work with people in your industry ? Have you ever heard about <b>Hybrid Work</b> (the type of work that 
allows you to work onsite or offsite even at your favorite coffee shop).

More and more coworking coffee shops are opening in the world to meet that demand (especially in Southeast Asia). And my app promote the connection for coworking and discussing of people in such coffee shops.
